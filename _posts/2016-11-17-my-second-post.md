<p>I think Jekyll works well for smaller projects such as presentations and blogs, almost to any
 website BUT Jekyll has no database, which means that users can not contribute to the website,
  they can not log in to the website. Companies that offers you to shop online cant use jekyll,
 because it's impossible to add stuff to a shopping cart without any database. </p>
