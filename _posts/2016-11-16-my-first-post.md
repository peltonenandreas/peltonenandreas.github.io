<p>I think it is an easy way to write CSS, it's a great tool so
 you don't need to repeat your code. (DRY) "its Manage your content"</p>

<p>I used jekylls boilerplate as a basis for this page
 but i changed a little bit in the layout, just so i could have it my way! The markdown format was new to me,
 I really liked it! It's super nice for taking notes in a meeting or just wirte blogposts, like im doing right now.</p>
 
<p>When you visiting a jekyll based homepage, you visiting pre-rendered html, there is no database which means that you
  have a high speed page, high security, cheaper to host beacuse of github.</p>
